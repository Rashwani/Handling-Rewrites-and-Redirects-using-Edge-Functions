# Handling Rewrites and Redirects Using AWS Edge Functions

This project showcases how to manage URL rewrites and redirects using **CloudFront Functions** and **Lambda@Edge**. These AWS edge services allow you to efficiently handle HTTP request modifications closer to the user, improving performance and reducing latency for global users.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on using AWS edge computing services to perform URL rewrites and redirects at the edge, ensuring that requests are processed closer to the end user for faster response times. This is particularly useful for global content delivery networks (CDNs) where performance and quick routing adjustments are crucial.

### Key AWS Services Used

- **Amazon CloudFront**: Provides a global CDN to deliver content with low latency.
- **CloudFront Functions**: Lightweight edge functions that modify requests and responses for simple use cases such as URL rewrites.
- **Lambda@Edge**: Used for more complex request/response modifications, including advanced redirects and conditional logic.
- **S3 (optional)**: Stores static content served through CloudFront.

### Architecture

The architecture includes the following components:

1. **CloudFront Distribution**: Set up to distribute content globally and manage incoming requests.
2. **CloudFront Functions**: Handles simple URL rewrites at the edge with minimal latency.
3. **Lambda@Edge**: For more complex routing and redirects that require additional logic, Lambda@Edge processes requests and adjusts the URL or headers accordingly.
4. **Amazon S3 (optional)**: Acts as the origin for static content delivery.

### How It Works

1. **User Request**: A user makes a request to CloudFront.
2. **Rewrite or Redirect at the Edge**: CloudFront Functions or Lambda@Edge processes the request, rewriting or redirecting the URL based on predefined rules.
3. **Serve Content**: After the modification, CloudFront either serves the requested content from the cache or forwards the request to the origin server (e.g., S3).
4. **Improved Performance**: By handling rewrites and redirects at the edge, the application reduces latency and improves user experience, especially for global users.

### Benefits of Edge Functions

- **Reduced Latency**: By processing requests closer to the user, latency is minimized.
- **Global Scalability**: CloudFront and Lambda@Edge automatically scale to handle large numbers of requests worldwide.
- **Customization**: Fine-tune how requests are processed without modifying backend systems.
- **Cost Efficiency**: CloudFront Functions are cost-effective for lightweight request processing.

## Setup and Deployment

To replicate this project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a CloudFront Distribution**: Distribute your static content globally through CloudFront.
2. **Configure CloudFront Functions**: Set up simple URL rewrites at the edge by creating and associating CloudFront Functions with your distribution.
3. **Set Up Lambda@Edge**: Deploy Lambda@Edge functions for more complex rewrite and redirect logic.
4. **Test and Deploy**: Test the rewrites and redirects by making requests to the CloudFront distribution and ensuring the correct responses.
5. **Monitor and Optimize**: Use CloudFront metrics to monitor performance and optimize the configuration as needed.

## Skills and Learnings

- Using CloudFront Functions for lightweight request modifications.
- Implementing Lambda@Edge for advanced routing and redirects.
- Managing global content delivery with CloudFront.
- Optimizing latency and performance through edge computing.
